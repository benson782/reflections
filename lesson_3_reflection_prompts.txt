When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Have a backup location incase the local gets destroyed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The local and remote repos might not be in sycn since the remote could be ahead of the local repo.
