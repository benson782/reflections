When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Have a backup location incase the local gets destroyed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The local and remote repos might not be in sycn since the remote could be ahead of the local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is like clone but only on GitHu.  Clone is making a copy of a repo.  Branches is on a repo when you want to diverge from the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work with it offline when you don't have internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Use SVN.  In SVN, branches are just copies of the parent code.  So, branches are not connected to their parent.  You have to add that info to the comments.  Switch between branched would be harder too.  You have to checkout each branch.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

The new changes could break the master or you don't want to add the changes tot he master until they are reviewed.  If you don't branch and add to the master directly, you don't have to worry if are not current with other peoples changes.  You will always be current since you are making changes directly to the master.
