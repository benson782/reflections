When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Have a backup location incase the local gets destroyed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The local and remote repos might not be in sycn since the remote could be ahead of the local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is like clone but only on GitHu.  Clone is making a copy of a repo.  Branches is on a repo when you want to diverge from the master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work with it offline when you don't have internet access.
